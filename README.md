# QuHack4IA_VQNN-track Repository

This repository contains code and data related to the QuHack4IAâ€“ Quantum Hackathon for Industrial Applications (12-13 September 2023), Variational Quantum Neural Network (VQNN) track project.

Concrete compressive strength is the measure of the ability to withstand axial loads without failing and is typically expressed in megapascals (MPa). Achieving the desired compressive strength is crucial in ensuring the structural integrity and safety of concrete-based structures.

Here we train multiple VQNNs to learn how different features determine the concrete compressive strength. This is done by analysing a dataset of 1030 instances with 8 different features.

In addition developed a demo of ***COMPRESS BOT*** a chatbot able to predict the concrete compressive strength from given ingredients.

## Device Comparison
We compute the Mean Square Error (MSE) for both the below approaches.
### Classical approach
- Normalized dataset:
  - MSE: 0.014592172783657214
- Normalized dataset with features reduction:
  - MSE: 0.014217871731188965
- Normalized dataset with features reduction and without outliers:
  - MSE: 0.014926592236208975
### Quantum approach
- Normalized dataset:
  - MSE: 0.10057372
- Normalized dataset with features reduction:
  - MSE: 0.039087
- Normalized dataset with features reduction and without outliers:
  - MSE: 0.043391567
